<p>
    <ul>
        <li>we remain oblivious to the future, </li>
        <li>lost to the past and enduring our torture.</li>
        <li>Forever we take chances to settle our scores,</li> 
        <li>losing some battles and winning some wars.</li>
        <li>Forever praying out loud hoping someone will hear, 
        <li>forever crying softly but never shedding a tear.</li> 
        <li>Forever exists behind a disguise, </li>
        <li>but the belief in forever keeps our hearts alive.</li>
</ul>
